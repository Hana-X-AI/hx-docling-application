## Lessons Learned

### Project Setup Phase

| ID | Category | Lesson | Impact | Prevention |
|----|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| LL-001 | Agent/Team Selection | Always verify assigned team member roles and expertise against project requirements | Medium | Confirm qualifications match task type before assignment |
| LL-002 | Process | Establish governance structure and tracking documents before starting active development phases | Low | Include governance setup in Phase 0 checklist |
| LL-003 | Documentation | All team members must review available reference documentation completely before starting work | High | Mandatory context review step in each phase |
| LL-004 | Documentation | Maintain centralized knowledge repositories and ensure accessibility to all team members | Medium | Include knowledge repository location in briefing materials |
| LL-005 | Documentation | Establish clear file placement conventions and enforce gitignore rules consistently | Medium | Document and enforce file placement standards |
| LL-006 | Accuracy | Verify task parameters and assignments match intended targets before final submission | High | Implement review checkpoint for critical task assignments |

### Design & Specification Phase

| ID | Category | Lesson | Impact | Prevention |
|----|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| LL-007 | Process | Multi-reviewer feedback requires structured consolidation and conflict resolution mechanisms | Medium | Use standard review consolidation template |
| LL-008 | Technical | Prefer lightweight, already-available tools over additional dependencies when possible | Low | Document standard tool preferences |
| LL-009 | Security | Apply principle of least privilege consistently across all configurations | Medium | Include security checklist in review process |
| LL-010 | Standards | Establish and enforce platform-wide standards for common infrastructure patterns | High | Document standards in project templates |
| LL-011 | Documentation | Framework-specific guidance must be included in specifications where applicable | Medium | Add framework considerations to specification template |
| LL-012 | Verification | Reviewer findings should be independently verified against actual implementation before accepting | Medium | Require evidence/references for reported issues |
| LL-013 | Technical | Type safety and validation mechanisms reduce runtime errors significantly | Medium | Include in project templates where applicable |
| LL-014 | Technical | Proper lifecycle management (shutdown handling, graceful degradation) is essential for production systems | Medium | Include in platform requirements |
| LL-015 | Documentation | Effort estimates must include detailed breakdown by component/activity | Low | Update estimation guidelines |

### Task Breakdown & Planning Phase

| ID | Category | Lesson | Impact | Prevention |
|----|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| LL-016 | Standards | Enforce consistent file naming conventions (e.g., lowercase-with-hyphens) across all deliverables | Medium | Include naming standards in generation prompts |
| LL-017 | Process | Parallel task creation by multiple teams works well when proper number ranges prevent conflicts | Low | Use reserved numbering ranges for parallel workstreams |
| LL-018 | Quality | Auto-generated documents can contain metadata inconsistencies - review for accuracy before release | Medium | Add quality check step for generated content |
| LL-019 | Process | Independent review of task summaries catches quality issues before execution | Medium | Include task review in planning phase checklist |
| LL-020 | Estimation | Add contingency buffer (typically 15-20%) to sequential effort estimates for debugging/rework | Medium | Apply standard contingency factor to all estimates |
| LL-021 | Traceability | Requirements-to-task mapping gaps cause scope creep and incomplete implementation | High | Perform coverage analysis between requirements and tasks during Phase 3 |
| LL-022 | Consistency | Specification updates during later phases indicate traceability gaps in earlier phases | Medium | Include requirements-to-tasks traceability matrix in planning |

### Governance Phase

| ID | Category | Lesson | Impact | Prevention |
|----|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| LL-023 | Documentation | Governance documents (RAIDD, Status, Backlog) must be populated before development starts, not left as empty templates | High | Include governance population in Phase 0 checklist |
| LL-024 | Traceability | Charter content (risks, assumptions, dependencies, decisions) must be migrated to RAIDD log for active tracking | Medium | Create RAIDD entries as charter sections are written |
| LL-025 | Quality | Version references in dependent documents must be updated when source document version changes | Medium | Include cross-reference validation in release checklist |

### Team Review Phase

| ID | Category | Lesson | Impact | Prevention |
|----|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| LL-026 | Agent/Team Selection | Agent persona names (e.g., "Trinity") must align with subagent type capabilities (e.g., `@trinity` = PostgreSQL DBA, not Next.js) | High | Verify subagent types match persona role definitions before team roster creation |
| LL-027 | Process | Multi-specialist review (11 reviewers) identifies significantly more gaps than single-reviewer approach | High | Use multi-specialist review for all major project charters |
| LL-028 | Documentation | Quality gate thresholds must include enforcement mechanism documentation (CI/CD, pre-commit hooks), not just numeric targets | High | Include enforcement toolchain in all quality gate specifications |
| LL-029 | Process | Complex sprints (like Sprint 1.5 with MCP/SSE) require explicit sub-task breakdown with handoff points | Medium | Create sub-task decomposition for any sprint with multiple domain handoffs |
| LL-030 | Technical | Database operational requirements (connection pooling, SSL, backups) must be addressed pre-development, not deferred | High | Include database operational checklist in Phase 0 |
| LL-031 | Documentation | Server vs Client component boundaries in Next.js App Router must be explicitly annotated to prevent bundle bloat | Medium | Include component type table in all Next.js project specifications |
| LL-032 | Process | Sprint handoff checklist template prevents incomplete deliverables and ensures consistent quality gates | Medium | Create and enforce sprint handoff checklist for all projects |
| LL-033 | Verification | Team review findings should be consolidated into key-gaps document for prioritized action | Medium | Create key-gaps summary after multi-specialist reviews |

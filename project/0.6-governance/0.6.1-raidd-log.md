## Decisions

| ID | Date | Decision | Rationale | Made By | Status |
|----|------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| DEC-001 | 2025-12-11 | Phase 1/Phase 2 separation | Phase 1 = Development on hx-cc-server (bare metal Node.js), Phase 2 = Deployment on hx-dev-server (Docker). Allows focus on core functionality before containerization. | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-002 | 2025-12-11 | Next.js 16 with App Router | Latest stable version, Turbopack default, aligns with hx-shadcn-server standard. React 19 included. | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-003 | 2025-12-11 | Zustand over Redux for state management | Minimal footprint (~1KB), SSR-ready out of box, simpler mental model, no boilerplate | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-004 | 2025-12-11 | Prisma as ORM for PostgreSQL | Type-safe database access, auto-generated types, built-in migration support, excellent Next.js integration | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-005 | 2025-12-11 | 8 MCP tools for Phase 1 scope | convert_pdf, convert_docx, convert_xlsx, convert_pptx, convert_url + export_markdown, export_html, export_json. Remaining 13 tools deferred to backlog. | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-006 | 2025-12-11 | Plugin architecture deferred to Phase 2 | Requires ecosystem planning, security sandbox considerations, version compatibility strategy, community feedback | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-007 | 2025-12-11 | No user authentication in Phase 1 | Anonymous sessions via Redis sufficient for initial release. AD/Kerberos integration via hx-dc-server deferred to future phase. | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-008 | 2025-12-11 | Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute per session | Prevents abuse while allowing normal usage patterns. Enforced at /api/process endpoint with 429 response. | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-009 | 2025-12-11 | SSE with fallback to polling for progress updates | SSE provides real-time updates; polling fallback ensures functionality if SSE fails after 10 retries | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-010 | 2025-12-11 | 90-day retention for jobs/results, 30-day for files | Balances storage costs with user needs. Automated cleanup via cron scripts. | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-011 | 2025-12-11 | Database connection pooling (connection_limit=5) | Prevents connection exhaustion under load; pool_timeout=20s for graceful handling | Trinity | APPROVED |
| DEC-012 | 2025-12-11 | SSL/TLS required for database connections | sslmode=require in DATABASE_URL; data must be encrypted in transit | Trinity | APPROVED |
| DEC-013 | 2025-12-11 | Quality gate enforcement via husky + GitHub Actions | Pre-commit hooks for local enforcement; CI/CD gates block merge on failure | Julia Santos | APPROVED |
| DEC-014 | 2025-12-11 | Sprint 1.5 sub-task breakdown with explicit handoffs | Most complex sprint requires 4 sub-tasks with handoff points and integration checkpoint | Agent Zero | APPROVED |
| DEC-015 | 2025-12-11 | Server vs Client component boundaries explicit | All 15+ components annotated with Server/Client designation to prevent bundle bloat | Neo | APPROVED |
| DEC-016 | 2025-12-11 | Daily database backups with WAL archiving | pg_dump at 01:00 UTC + WAL for PITR; RTO 4h, RPO 1h | Trinity | APPROVED |
